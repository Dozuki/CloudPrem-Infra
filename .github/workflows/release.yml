            Dual Module Refactor
            - Refactored root module splitting into 2 modules instead of 4, one for physical resources, one for logical resources.
            - No longer using S3 module for buckets, we use raw resources now for increased compatibility and reduced complexity.
            - Massive BI improvements. Streamlined DMS creation and management, improved database ingest & in-transit SSL.
            - Encrypting K8 Secrets using KMS.
            - Upgraded most off-the-shelf terraform module versions.
