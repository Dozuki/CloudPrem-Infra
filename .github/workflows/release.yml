            BI Restricted Access & Scaling Fixes
            - Fixed an issue which occurs when using a whitelist for public BI access preventing dashboards from working.
            - Fixed Kubernetes cluster autoscaler minsize to respect variable configuration. No longer hard coded at 1.
            - Updated cluster autoscaler Helm chart to v9.21.0
